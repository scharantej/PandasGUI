<h1>About</h1>

<p>This website was created to provide an interactive interface to a pandas DataFrame. The data in the DataFrame is from a variety of sources, including public datasets and private sources.</p>

<p>The website is built using Flask, a Python web framework. The HTML code is generated using the Assistant, a tool that helps developers create HTML code for Flask applications.</p>

<p>The website is open source and available on GitHub.</p>
