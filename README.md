 ## Flask Application Design for Interactive Pandas DataFrame Website

### HTML Files

#### `index.html`
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point for the website.
- It will contain the necessary HTML elements to display the pandas DataFrame in a tabular format.
- It will also include a form to allow users to interact with the DataFrame, such as filtering or sorting the data.

#### `about.html`
- This HTML file will provide information about the website and its purpose.
- It can include details about the data source, the creators of the website, or any other relevant information.

### Routes

#### `/`
- This route will handle the main page of the website.
- It will render the `index.html` file and pass the pandas DataFrame to it.

#### `/about`
- This route will handle the about page of the website.
- It will render the `about.html` file.

#### `/filter`
- This route will handle the filtering of the pandas DataFrame.
- It will receive the filter criteria from the user and return the filtered DataFrame.

#### `/sort`
- This route will handle the sorting of the pandas DataFrame.
- It will receive the sort criteria from the user and return the sorted DataFrame.

### Additional Considerations

- The Flask application should be designed to be responsive, ensuring that it can be accessed and used effectively on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.
- The application should also incorporate appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
